This project has a welcome interface in both English and Spanish.

The user is asked to select the language from the two buttons in the upper part of the window 
("Bienvenido!" - for using Spanish language for the rest of the sesion or "Welcome!" - for using English 
for the rest of the session). 

After the credentials are checked this window will not be visible anymore and the one coresponding with the language previously selected will be now visible. The user is not allowed to change the language during the sesion. To do so, it has to close the sesion and reopen another one.


The app has 6 main pannels. 
    * The first one is about the "medical teams". This tab offers edditable options only to admin users. The standard users can only see the informations from this tab.
        - Here, the admin user can see all the teams (each one it's own pannel), change the name of the team or delete it from the data base - only if there are no doctors in this team anymore.
        - There can also be added new teams. In order to do so, the new team has to have a coordinator and a member. After the new team is creater, new doctors can be added to the team or other doctors can be transfered to this team.
        - "See medic list" is the tab where a new doctor can be added to an existing team and into the data base, the selected doctor can also be removed from the team and from the data base - his current patients will be transfered to his coordinator. Furthermore, this tab also gives the possibility to move the selected doctor to another team, change the medical leader of a team with another doctor from the same team (OBS! if the leader to be changed is in another team, then this doctor needs to be moved first in the team to which he will be the coodinator and than change the coordinator).
        
    * "Patients" tab gives informations about one or all patients. It is not restricted only to admin or standard users.
